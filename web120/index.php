    <p>Hello my name is George Allison, I am 26 years old and grew up in Japan before moving to the States in elementary school. I Graduated Western Washington University in 2015 with a music performance degree and began my own business teaching private music lessons to all ages. Soon I had amounted over 40 students and was successfully building a wait list for more!</p>

    <p>After a few years of this I felt that I wanted to try my hand at the big city and moved down to Seattle with the hopes of creating my own private teaching studio. But the competition stood too strong and the students did not come... This is when I decided to re-educate myself in computer science to boost my resume and try to land myself a high paying job.</p>
